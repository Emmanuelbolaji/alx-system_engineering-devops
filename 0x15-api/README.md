# 0x15. API

## Description
This project is part of the ALX System Engineering & DevOps curriculum. It focuses on working with REST APIs, handling JSON data, and exporting data to different formats.

## Files

### 0-gather_data_from_an_API.py
A Python script that uses a REST API to fetch and display an employee's TODO list progress.

Usage:
### 1-export_to_CSV.py
An extension of the previous script that exports the TODO list data to a CSV file.

Usage:
## Requirements
- All scripts are written in Python 3.
- Libraries used: requests, sys, csv
- Code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- Must use `get` to access dictionary values by key
- Code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`)

## API Used
These scripts use the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API, a fake online REST API for testing and prototyping.
